2. Extract the `HtmlMinifier.exe` to your desired location
3. Add the tool to your PATH or reference it directly

## 🚀 Quick Start

Transform verbose HTML into compact, optimized code:

### Before:

```html
<h2>
    Admin Menu</h2>
<ul>
    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Edit blog entries", "List", "Admin")</li>
    <li>@Html.ActionLink("View Comments", "CommentList", "Admin")</li>
    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Clear Cache", "ClearCache", "Admin")</li>
</ul>
```

### After:

```html
<h2> Admin Menu</h2><ul><li>@Html.ActionLink("Edit blog entries", "List", "Admin")</li><li>@Html.ActionLink("View Comments", "CommentList", "Admin")</li><li>@Html.ActionLink("Clear Cache", "ClearCache", "Admin")</li></ul>
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

Minify all HTML files in a folder (including subfolders):

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder"
```

### Advanced Options

#### Limit Line Length

Restrict the maximum number of characters per line:

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder" "60000"
```

#### Preserve Comments

For frameworks that rely on HTML comments (Angular, Knockout, etc.), preserve them:

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder" ignorehtmlcomments
```

#### Preserve JavaScript Comments

Keep JavaScript comments in your code:

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder" ignorejscomments
```

#### Preserve Knockout Comments

Specifically preserve [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) comments:

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder" ignoreknockoutcomments
```

### Multiple Targets

#### Minify Multiple Folders

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder\fld1" "C:\Folder\fld2"
```

#### Minify Specific Files

```bash
HtmlMinifier.exe "C:\Folder\file1.html" "C:\Folder\file2.html"
```
